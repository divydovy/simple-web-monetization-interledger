A simple plugin to add Web Monetization to a WordPress site. 

== Description ==

A simple plugin to add Web Monetization to a WordPress site, provided on behalf of Interleger. Features include:

* Select from a list of charity payment pointers or add your own
* Enable or disable Web Monetization for the site
* When Web Monetization is enabled, every front end page served by your WordPress site will include Web Monetization

> The ability to transfer money has been a long-standing omission from the web platform. As a result, the web suffers from a flood of advertising and corrupt business models. Web Monetization provides an open, native, efficient, and automatic way to compensate creators, pay for API calls, and support crucial web infrastructure.

Web Monetization is a proposed W3C standard for allowing browsers to stream payments to website owners using Interledger which is an open protocol. For more information about Web Monetization, please visit [https://webmonetization.org/](https://webmonetization.org/).
